# International Debt Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze international debt data from The World Bank to understand the distribution and magnitude of debt among developing countries. The project involves querying a PostgreSQL database, performing data analysis, and visualizing key insights about the debt indicators and amounts.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.
Data source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/international-debt-statistics/)

## Project Structure
- *notebook.ipynb*: Jupyter Notebook containing the SQL queries and analysis.
- *README.md*: Project overview and instructions.

## Key Responsibilities
- Collected international debt data from The World Bank outsourced on Kaggle
- Established connection to the international_debt PostgreSQL database
- Queried and retrieved initial data from the international_debt table
- Determined the number of unique countries in the dataset
- Extracted and categorized distinct debt indicators
- Calculated the total amount of debt owed by the countries
- Identified the country with the highest total debt
- Computed the average amount of debt across different debt indicators
- Analyzed the country with the highest debt in the long-term debt category
- Identified the most common debt indicators affecting all countries
- Found maximum debt amounts across various indicators along with respective country name

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL for data querying and analysis
- Jupyter Notebook for documentation

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of international debt, highlighting key insights and trends in debt distribution among developing countries. The use of SQL and Jupyter Notebook allows for efficient data querying and analysis, making the findings easily interpretable.
